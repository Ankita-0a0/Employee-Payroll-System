Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository showcases a terminal-based application designed to manage employee records and payroll processing. By leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, you'll explore concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. The project includes features for adding and updating employee information, calculating salaries, managing deductions, and generating payroll reports. This hands-on experience will enhance your Java skills and deepen your understanding of software development best practices.



#Project Highlights:

The Employee Payroll System project features an abstract Employee class that serves as the foundation for various employee types, including concrete subclasses like FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, each with specific salary calculation methods. It includes a user-friendly terminal interface, enabling seamless interaction and efficient data management. This project exemplifies core Object-Oriented Programming concepts, providing practical coding examples for better comprehension. With complete source code and a step-by-step guide, it’s tailored for learners at all levels. Whether you’re a beginner eager to dive into Java or an experienced developer looking to refine your OOP skills, this project offers valuable insights and hands-on experience. Clone the repository, explore the code, and elevate your Java programming capabilities!
